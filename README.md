## What is Homebrew?

Homebrew aims to be a community of FOSS enthusiasts, as well as the one-stop
shop for those curious about and interested in FOSS. It aims to be a forum
where enthusiasts can discuss their favorite open source technologies, and
discuss them with other enthusiasts, while also keeping track of alternatives
and suggesting different software. Students can also exhibit their projects in
the "Homebrew Expo" that occurs every week, akin to the actual Homebrew.

## Who is Homebrew catering to?

The students of PES university, EC campus. As well as every human on earth
interested in FOSS.

## Why Homebrew?

There's no major FOSS Community in PES, which is somewhat detrimental to the
FOSS situation on campus. It's necessary to have a bunch of enthusiasts who are
open about their ideals as well as their software to ensure the free software
and FOSS message gets passed on to future generations.
